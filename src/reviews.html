            Not only did they bring fresh squeezed cactus juice for all of the residents, but they also painted my roof with UV ink for free!"

            I hired RoyCo back in September to build an indoor pool in my apartment's kitchen.

            The young man Chad seemed a bit new, but he managed to get the job done 2 days earlier than expected.

            These guy's were amazing!! I was working that day and I got a call from the head honch Roy, who had informed me that they had accidentally removed my roof...
            <br><br>
            Since they accidentally tore my roof off, they gave me 10 percent off for some tarps put on my house.

            Very happy with RoyCo Roofing And Construction. I needed to replace my roof which suffered hail damage. I ordered an upgraded roof and they came in and completed it one day. 
            <br><br>
            The old roof was stripped, new roof applied, and all the trash and nails picked up. I worked with Chad through out the whole process and he was extremely helpful.

            I hired RoyCo to take the roof off my car because I always wanted a convertible. They thought I meant to convert my gas engine to a hybrid system. 
            <br><br>
            So thanks to RoyCo my fuel economy is much improved.
            Also they installed a cassette player Boom Box into the dash with a Kenny Loggins tape pre-loaded.

            My neighbor hired RoyCo Roofing to replace their roof and Chad and SteveDave came out to my house while I was at work and replaced my roof instead.
            <br><br>
            They did an incredible job
